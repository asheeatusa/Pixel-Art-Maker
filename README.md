## Instructions

I started this porject to learn more about the DOM and JS. My goal is to be expert in using event listner and build apps that are efficient and scalable. I will keep building and adding cool functionality as i learn more about JS and the DOM API.
<!-- To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality. -->

<!-- For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me). -->
